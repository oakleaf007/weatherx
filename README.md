# 🌦️ Weather Widget — Open-Meteo Integration

A small, client-side weather widget that shows current weather and a 7-day forecast with clickable day buttons.  
This project uses the **Open-Meteo** APIs (no API key required) and performs city name → coordinates geocoding, then fetches current and daily/hourly forecasts.
